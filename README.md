# ReactiveBeaver (preparing first version)
#### NOT released.
ePub parser for iOS and OS X.
Core parts are designed to be functional and are written in ReactiveCocoa.

### Main goals and principles

- High tests coverage.
- Performance optimization
- Functional and non-functional usage.
- ePub 2 and 3 specification support.

### Usage
#### Standard

```objc

NSString *soucePath = ... /// path of the .zip or .epub file
NSString *destinationPath = ... /// destination folder to unarchive

self.parser = [RBParser parserWithSourcePath:sourcePath destinationPath:destinationPath];
[self.parser.startParsingWithCompletionBlock:^(RBEpub * _Nullable epub, NSError * _Nullable error) {
  /// process data here
}];

```
#### RFP
This type of usage is built on the reactive-functional approach (based on the ReactiveCocoa 2.0 framework)

```objc

[[[self.parser startCommand].executionSignals
  flattenMap:^(RACSignal *parsingSignal) {
      return parsingSignal;
  }]
 subscribeNext:^(RBEpub *epub) {
    /// do additional stuff with parsed epub data
 }
 error:^(NSError *error) {
    /// process error
 }];

NSString *soucePath = ... /// path of the .zip or .epub file
NSString *destinationPath = ... /// destination folder to unarchive

/// Start of the actual parsing
[[self.parser startCommand] execute:RACTuplePack(sourcePath, destinationPath)];

```
